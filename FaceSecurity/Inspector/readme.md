# Source Code for Inspector

Source code for Inspector: Inspector for Face Forgery Detection: Defending Against Adversarial Attacks From Coarse to Fine (IEEE TIP 2024: https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2024.3434388)

# Introduction

# Prepraration

### Dependencies

The project's runtime environment is based on Miniconda. You can use the following command to install the project's runtime environmentï¼š

``conda create --name Inspector --file requirements.txt``


### Datasets

Our training is conducted on the FaceForensics++ dataset, which can be downloaded from the repository [FaceForensics](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics) and place it in the ``data/``.

# Training

After preparing the dataset and placing it in the corresponding path. Run the training scripts in the ``train`` folder in the following order: ``train_dec.sh``, ``train_rec.sh``, ``train_aut.sh``, ``train_cor.sh`` . If you wish to modify the relevant configurations, please make the changes within the corresponding script files.

# Testing
This test is divided into two stages: coarse defense and fine defense:

The results of the first stage are obtained by running ``test_aut.sh``.
The results of the second stage are obtained by running ``test_cor.sh``. 

Of course, just like with training, you can modify the scripts to change configurations.

# Trained model

You can download our trained model from this [BaiduDisk link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hBuHfQ5WsXFR6T1HhTFi4g) (Password:`jmc4`).

Then, place the four files in the initial path of the current project.
